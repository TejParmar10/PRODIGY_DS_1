task 1
Dataset-Titanic
Using Power Bi created a histogram where I took two columns age and survived columns.
For age column I divided the bucket into 10 which means that a group of 10 people was created.
on x-axis-Age column and y-axis-Survived column.
According to the data provided we can figure it out that between the range of age 0-9 years of age
38 people have survived.
This is an example how we can use histogram for our data
